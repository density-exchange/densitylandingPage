Density merely acts as a facilitator for the trading in Cryptos by User, and provides other ancillary services in relation thereto, which are more fully set out hereunder.
                </li>
                <li>Density does not provide any warranty or / and guarantee of any kind, either express or implied, in relation to the Services.

Further, in the event that a user resides in any Restricted Jurisdiction, such users are not permitted to use Services in any form ("Restricted Jurisdiction Use"). Any Restricted Jurisdiction Use will amount to a breach, and Density shall forthwith be entitled to terminate the use and operation of the user’s Account, shall extend all cooperation to the relevant governmental and enforcement authorities, and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any Loss arising out of such, in relation to, or subsequent to such Restricted Jurisdiction Use. Users are therefore duly warned against availing of Services in any manner whatsoever in or from a Restricted Jurisdiction, or from anywhere outside India. Users shall be solely responsible for ensuring compliance with this requirement, and for compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in or from where they are availing of Services. Users are hereby duly cautioned that presently in India, "virtual currencies" (including all Digital Assets, cryptocurrency tokens and digital assets) have not been recognized or authorised as a medium for payment, as a commodity for trade, or in any form, by central bank, monetary authority, or governmental or regulatory body in India. The Reserve Bank of India has currently issued three press release viz. dated 24th December 2013, 1st February 2017 and 5th December 2017 respectively, cautioning users, holders and traders against the use of, and trading in, virtual currencies. Users shall therefore avail of Services subject to the above caution issued by the RBI, and should be aware of the regulatory and financial risks inherent in dealing with Digital Assets in any manner.
